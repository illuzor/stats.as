This class provides a simple info box that will help you monitor your code performance.

* FPS Frames per second, how many frames were rendered in 1 second. The higher the number, the better.
* MS Milliseconds needed to render a frame. The lower number, the better.
* MEM Memory your code is using, if it increases per frame is VERY wrong.
* MAX Maximum memory the application reached.

### How to use ###

	addChild( new Stats() );

### Controls ###

* **LEFT CLICK** on the top-half/bottom-half part of the panel to increase/decrease the movie FPS limit.
